# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz

This package exports a single lower-case 25-character string containing the modern English alphabet without `w`, suitable for using as-is, or for safely interpolating, without the need for escaping, into nearly any context. The purpose of this package is to reduce the need for repetitious typing and the risk of typographical errors, and to serve as an alternative to the [`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz), optimized for clarity in the character set.

## Installation

```bash
npm install abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz
```

## Usage

```js
import { abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz } from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'

console.log(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz)
// "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz"
```
